# Compound Transaction Blacklist Agent

## Description

This agent monitors Ethereum network and detects Compound transactions that involve blacklisted addresses.

## Compound Network

Compound Finance uses different addresses in different Ethereum networks (Mainnet, Rinkeby, Goeli etc...).
To make the agent more testable, we get addresses from official [compound-finance/compound-protocol](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol) repository for the network provided in `COMPOUND_NETWORK` constant.

## Settings

First of all, it is necessary to provide the desired network: 

```js
export const COMPOUND_NETWORK = CompoundNetworkNames.MAINNET;
``` 

Then, specify all the blacklisted addresses you want to warn about:

```js
export const BLACKLISTED_ADDRESSES = [
  '0xb4f011d8ce90e13cdec209deb06025fbd9c0cba5',
  '0xa9497fd9d1dd0d00de1bf988e0e36794848900f9',
  // ... and others
];
```

That's it ðŸ˜Ž
